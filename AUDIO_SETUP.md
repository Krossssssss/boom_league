# Audio Setup Instructions

## Mobile-Friendly Audio System

I've implemented a mobile-friendly audio system that works on iOS, Android, and desktop browsers. Here's what you need to know:

## Required Audio Files

Add these audio files to the `public/audio/` directory:

1. **`background-music.mp3`** - Your background music track
   - Should be a looping-friendly track
   - Recommended: 30-60 seconds long, seamless loop
   - Format: MP3, OGG, or WAV

2. **`happy-sound.mp3`** - Sound effect for celebrations
   - Should be a short sound effect (1-3 seconds)
   - Format: MP3, OGG, or WAV

## How It Works

### Desktop Browsers
- Audio starts automatically when user interacts with music controls
- Background music and sound effects work normally

### Mobile Browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile)
- Shows an "Enable Audio" overlay on first visit
- User must tap to unlock audio (required by mobile browsers)
- After unlocking, all audio functions work normally

## Features

- ✅ **Mobile Compatible**: Works on iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile, etc.
- ✅ **Autoplay Policy Compliant**: Respects browser autoplay restrictions
- ✅ **Fallback Support**: Graceful degradation if audio fails
- ✅ **Volume Control**: Mute/unmute functionality
- ✅ **Sound Effects**: Happy sound when appropriate
- ✅ **Background Music**: Looping background music

## Audio File Recommendations

### Background Music
- Use royalty-free music or create your own
- Suggested sources:
  - Freesound.org (CC licensed)
  - YouTube Audio Library
  - Local recordings

### Sound Effects
- Short, punchy celebration sounds
- Suggested: bell chimes, success sounds, party sounds

## Testing

1. **Desktop**: Should work immediately when music controls are used
2. **Mobile**: 
   - First visit shows "Enable Audio" overlay
   - Tap to enable audio
   - Music and sound effects should work after enabling

## Troubleshooting

If audio doesn't work:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Ensure audio files are in `public/audio/` directory
3. Try different audio formats (MP3, OGG, WAV)
4. Test on different devices/browsers

## Current Status

- ✅ Audio system implemented
- ✅ Mobile browser support added  
- ✅ UI integration completed
- ⏳ **Need to add actual audio files** to `public/audio/`

Once you add the audio files, the system will be fully functional!
